# LoRaWAN example Sub-Band usage

## Description

In the LoRaWAN protocol, there are detailed regulations in various countries or regions. These regulations include uplink and downlink Channel Frequency, Bandwidth, Duty cycle etc.

**[LoRaWAN 1.1 Regional Parameters](https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/lorawantm_regional_parameters_v1.1rb_-_final.pdf)**

Let's take AU915 as an example:

Then, let's look into our code: (in LoRaWan_APP.cpp file)

Here are 5 arrays defined all channels of LoRaWAN protocol for AU915. In the channelsMaskTemp[0], 0x00FF means use the first 0-7 channels, they are 915.2MHz, 915.4MHz, 915.6MHz … 916.6MHz. When you set the value to 0xFF00, it means the upload channels changed to 8-15, they are 916.8MHz, 917.0MHz … 918.2MHz. More detail... see the below picture：

TTN uses 2nd Sub-Band only (channels 8 to 15 and 65) for AU915:

## How To?

Generally speaking... we just need to change the `channelsMaskTemp[0]=0xFF00;`, then the uplink frequency will be changed to TTN supported.

*BTW. the listening frequency in your LoRa gateway must be the same as the TTN server. it's defined in your gateway's `gloable_conf.json` file.*
